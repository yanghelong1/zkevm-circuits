/*
An account leaf occupies 8 rows.
Contrary as in the branch rows, the `S` and `C` leaves are not positioned parallel to each other.
The rows are the following:
ACCOUNT_LEAF_KEY_S
ACCOUNT_LEAF_KEY_C
ACCOUNT_NON_EXISTING
ACCOUNT_LEAF_NONCE_BALANCE_S
ACCOUNT_LEAF_NONCE_BALANCE_C
ACCOUNT_LEAF_STORAGE_CODEHASH_S
ACCOUNT_LEAF_STORAGE_CODEHASH_C
ACCOUNT_DRIFTED_LEAF

The constraints in this file apply to ACCOUNT_LEAF_KEY_S and ACCOUNT_LEAF_KEY_C rows.

For example, the two rows might be:
[248,106,161,32,252,237,52,8,133,130,180,167,143,97,28,115,102,25,94,62,148,249,8,6,55,244,16,75,187,208,208,127,251,120,61,73,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
[248,106,161,32,252,237,52,8,133,130,180,167,143,97,28,115,102,25,94,62,148,249,8,6,55,244,16,75,187,208,208,127,251,120,61,73,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Here, in `ACCOUNT_LEAF_KEY_S` example row, there are key nibbles for `S` proof stored in compact form.
The nibbles start at `s_main.bytes[1]` and can go to `c_main.rlp2`.

In `ACCOUNT_LEAF_KEY_C` example row, there are key nibbles for `C` proof stored in compact form.
The nibbles start at `s_main.bytes[1]` and can go to `c_main.rlp2`.

The whole account leaf looks like:
[248,106,161,32,252,237,52,8,133,130,180,167,143,97,28,115,102,25,94,62,148,249,8,6,55,244,16,75,187,208,208,127,251,120,61,73,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

There are two main scenarios when an account is added to the trie:
 1. There exists another account which has the same address to the some point as the one that
 is being added, including the position of this account in the branch.
 In this case a new branch is added to the trie.
 The existing account drifts down one level to the new branch. The newly
 added account will also appear in this branch. For example, let us say that we have the account `A`
 with nibbles `[3, 12, 3]` in the trie. We then add the account `A1` with nibbles `[3, 12, 5]`
 to the trie. The branch will appear (at position `[3, 12]`) which will have `A` at position 3
 and `A1` at position 5. This means there will be an additional branch in `C` proof (or in `S`
 proof when the situation is reversed - we are deleting the leaf instead of adding) and
 for this reason we add a placeholder branch for `S` proof (for `C` proof in reversed situation)
 to preserve the circuit layout (more details about this technicality are given below).

 2. The branch where the new account is to be added has nil node at the position where the new account
 is to be added. For example, let us have a branch at `[3, 12]`, we are adding a leaf with the
 first three nibbles as `[3, 12, 5]`, and the position 5 in our branch is not occupied.
 There does not exist an account which has the same address to the some point.
 In this case, the `getProof` response does not end with a leaf, but with a branch.
 To preserve the layout, a placeholder account leaf is added.

                In this case we have 51 in `s_main.bytes[1]`, this presents the first nibble: `3 = 51 - 48`.
                From `s_main.bytes[2]` it is as in the even number case. We compute the RLC as:

                after branch placeholder, sel1/sel2 can be computed as follows.

                Note that we cannot rotate back into Branch 1S because we get PoisonedConstraint
                in extension_node_key.

                Instead, we can rotate into branch parallel to the placeholder branch and compute sel1/sel2 with info from there.
                Let's denote sel1/sel2 from this branch by sel1p/sel2p.

                There are a couple of different cases, for example when branch/extension node parallel
                to the placeholder branch is a regular branch.
                There is only one nibble taken by Branch 2C, so sel1/sel2 simply turns around compared to sel1p/sel2p:
                sel1 = sel2p
                sel2 = sel1p

                When branch/extension node parallel to the placeholder branch is an extension node, it depends on the
                number of nibbles. If there is an odd number of nibbles: sel1 = sel1p, sel2 = sel2p. If there is
                an even number of nibbles, it turns around.

                Note: _c16 presents the same info as sel1, _c1 presents the same info as sel2 (this information is doubled
                to reduce the degree when handling different cases in extension_node_key).
