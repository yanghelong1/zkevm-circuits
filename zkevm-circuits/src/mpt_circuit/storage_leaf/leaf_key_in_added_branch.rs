A storage leaf occupies 5 rows.
Contrary as in the branch rows, the `S` and `C` leaves are not positioned parallel to each other.
The rows are the following:
LEAF_KEY_S
LEAF_VALUE_S
LEAF_KEY_C
LEAF_VALUE_C
LEAF_DRIFTED

An example of leaf rows:

The `LEAF_DRIFTED` row is nonempty when a leaf is added (or deleted) to the position in trie where there is already
an existing leaf. This appears when an existing leaf and a newly added leaf have the same initial key nibbles.
In this case, a new branch is created and both leaves (existing and newly added) appear in the new branch.
`LEAF_DRIFTED` row contains the key bytes of the existing leaf once it drifted down to the new branch.

The constraints for `LEAF_DRIFTED` row are very similar to the ones for `LEAF_KEY` rows, but we have
different selectors (different row) and there are some scenarios that do not appear here, like being in
the first level of the trie. Also, when computing the leaf RLC, we need to take a different approach because
the leaf value for the drifted leaf is stored in a parallel proof.
